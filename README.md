# A-PROCESS-CONTROL-NETWORK-ANALYSIS-FOR-INDUSTRY

Introduction:

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), and Programmable Automation Controllers (PAC) allowed operators to monitor and control mechanical devices or even personal performance remotely using point-to-point communication.

This project will focus on a TCP based Process Control Network at a large industrial processing facility.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) emerged with the introduction of Ethernet to industrial sites and has become widely popular throughout the industry as it continues the simple, robust application layer protocol.

Project Scope:

The scope of this project consists of three parts:

Developing Architecture solutions for an industrial network to improve reliability through redundancy and the addition of monitoring and configuration tools to reduce downtime associated with communication issues reported by delay accounting software. â€‹

We are developing a theoretical framework for new switch configurations to allow for access to the device layer for a monitoring system for breakdown maintenance purposes. 

The Development of an Industrial network simulator that is capable of producing an industrial network model.
