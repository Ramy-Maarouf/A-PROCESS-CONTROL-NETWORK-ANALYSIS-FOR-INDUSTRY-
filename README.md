# A-PROCESS-CONTROL-NETWORK-ANALYSIS-FOR-INDUSTRY

Introduction:

Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), and Programmable Automation Controllers (PAC) allowed operators to monitor and control mechanical devices or even personal performance remotely using point-to-point communication.

This project will focus on a TCP based Process Control Network at a large industrial processing facility.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) emerged with the introduction of Ethernet to industrial sites and has become widely popular throughout the industry as it continues the simple, robust application layer protocol.

Project Scope:

The scope of this project consists of two parts:
A. The development of an Architecture solution for a real time complex industrial network to improve reliability through redundancy and the addition of monitoring and configuration tools to reduce downtime associated with communication issues reported by delay accounting software.

B. The development of automation script that is capable of doing certain task to improve the maintenance involved in the larger networks. It helps to configure, provision and analyse the network in an efficient way by running the script.
